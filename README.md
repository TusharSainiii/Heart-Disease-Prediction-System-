Heart Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

Overview:

This project implements a deep learning model to predict heart disease based on medical data. It leverages neural networks for classification, incorporating data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques to ensure high accuracy.

Features:

Data preprocessing and normalization

Feature selection for improving model performance

Neural network-based classification

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall

Visualizations for data insights

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Dataset:

The model is trained on a publicly available heart disease dataset, such as the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Ensure you download and preprocess the dataset before training.

Usage:

Modify config.py to adjust hyperparameters.

Run train.py to train the model.

Use predict.py to test new patient data.

Results:

The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting heart disease. Performance metrics and confusion matrices are included in the results directory.
